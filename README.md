# 🚀 HackerNews Top Stories API

This is a robust, high-performance ASP.NET Core API designed to retrieve and serve the top stories from the Hacker News public API. It implements several architectural and performance best practices, including **caching**, **rate limiting**, and **resilience policies** (Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout) via Polly.

## 🌟 Features

* **High Performance Caching:** Uses **Redis** as a distributed cache to store the latest top 200 stories, ensuring millisecond response times for API consumers.
* **Automatic Cache Warmup:** A dedicated `CacheWarmupHostedService` runs in the background to automatically refresh the cache data every **2 minutes**, ensuring the cache is always fresh.
* **Resilience (Polly):** Implements advanced policies for handling external API instability:
    * **Retry Policy:** Automatically retries transient HTTP errors (5xx) and `429 Too Many Requests`.
    * **Circuit Breaker:** Opens the circuit after 5 consecutive failures for 30 seconds to protect the upstream service (Hacker News API) from being overwhelmed.
    * **Timeout Policy:** Cancels long-running requests (over 8 seconds).
* **Authentication (JWT):** Secures the main data endpoints using **JWT Bearer** token authentication.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implements a Fixed Window Rate Limiter (60 requests/minute per authenticated client) to protect the API resources.
* **Dockerized:** Fully containerized and ready to run with `docker-compose`.

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally (Recommended: Docker)

The application is configured to run easily using Docker and Docker Compose, which sets up the necessary **ASP.NET Core API**, **Redis cache**, and **SQLite database** (for users).

### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### Steps

1.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory (into HackerNewsTopApi folder, where `docker-compose.yml` is located) and define the essential JWT settings.

    ```bash
    # .env file
    JWT_KEY=Your_Super_Secret_Key_That_Should_Be_Longer_Than_256Bits
    JWT_ISSUER=HackerNewsTopApi
    JWT_AUDIENCE=HackerNewsAppUsers
    ```

2.  **Build and Run the Containers:**
    Execute the following command in the root directory:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3.  **Access the API:**
    * **API Base URL (HTTP):** `http://localhost:5000`
    * **Swagger UI:** `http://localhost:5000/swagger`
    * The User admin/admin is created right away to get your token. Or you can create your own new user via `/api/Auth/register`.
    * Generate a token via `/api/Auth/login` to authenticate and get the Stories from HackerNews via `/api/Stories?count=N`, informing the number of stories you want. (Max is 200).

## 🔑 Authentication and Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints (`/api/Auth`)

To access the protected stories endpoint, you must first obtain a token via the `Auth` controller.

| Method | Path | Description | Example Body |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/api/Auth/register` | Creates a new user. | `{"username": "user", "password": "password"}` |
| `POST` | `/api/Auth/login` | Logs in and returns a JWT. | `{"username": "user", "password": "password"}` |

### Main Endpoints (`/api/Stories`)

| Method | Path | Security | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/Stories?count=N` | **[Authorize], [RateLimited]** | Retrieves the top `N` stories from the cache (max 200). |
| `POST` | `/api/Stories/warmup` | **[Authorize]** | Manually triggers the cache warming process for development/testing. |

## 🧠 Architectural Decisions and Rationale

The design emphasizes **performance**, **stability**, and **decoupling**.

| Component | Files | Decision Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Caching** | `HackerNewsService.cs`, `CacheWarmupHostedService.cs` | **Pre-fetching and Caching:** The Hacker News API is slow. By fetching and processing the data *every 2 minutes* in the background (`CacheWarmupHostedService`) and storing it in **Redis** (`IDistributedCache`), we shift the load from the user request time to the background process. This is crucial for user-facing latency. |
| **Resilience** | `PollyConfiguration.cs`, `Program.cs` | **Polly Policy Wrap:** Wrapping the `HttpClient` with a `Timeout` $\to$ `Circuit Breaker` $\to$ `Retry` strategy is essential. It prevents **cascading failures**, handles transient network issues gracefully (Retry), and protects both our service and the upstream HN API from overload (Circuit Breaker). |
| **Authentication** | `AuthService.cs`, `AuthController.cs` | **Decoupling and Security:** Separated authentication logic (`AuthService`) from the controller and used **BCrypt** for secure password hashing. Used standard **JWT Bearer** for stateless, scalable authentication. |
| **Rate Limiting** | `StoriesController.cs`, `Program.cs` | **Fixed Window Limiting:** Applied a `60 requests/minute` limit to the core data endpoint (`/api/Stories`) to ensure fair usage and protect API resources. |
| **Parallelism** | `HackerNewsService.cs` | **Throttled Parallel Requests:** Used a `SemaphoreSlim(10)` to fetch individual story details concurrently but limited the number of simultaneous HTTP requests to the external API, balancing speed with respect for the upstream service's capacity. |

```
| Request                       | Calls to HN                     | Time   |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------|
| GET /stories?count=10         | **0** (cache)                   | ~50ms  |
| GET /stories?count=50         | **0** (cache)                   | ~50ms  |
| GET /stories?count=200        | **0** (cache)                   | ~100ms |
| Background warmup (each 2min) | 1 (IDs) + 200 (itens) = **201** | ~8s    |

## ✨ Potential Improvements and Future Work

These items represent key improvements that would enhance reliability, maintainability, and user experience if development time allowed:

1.  **Comprehensive Health Checks:**
    * **Improvement:** Implement detailed ASP.NET Core Health Checks, exposing an endpoint (`/health`) that verifies the connection status of **Redis**, the **SQLite database**, and the **HackerNews external API**.

2.  **JWT Refresh Tokens:**
    * **Improvement:** Ensure the JWT key is loaded *only* from environment variables. For production, use Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar secure secret management services.
    * **Improvement:** Implement a refresh token mechanism. Currently, the JWT expires in 60 minutes.

3.  **Centralized Logging and Telemetry:**
    * **Improvement:** Add `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, and `[RegularExpression]` attributes to `Username` and `Password` properties in `LoginRequest` to enforce basic validation at the model binding stage.
    * **Improvement:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC). Add a `Role` property to the `User` model.
    * **Improvement:** Integrate with a structured logging provider (e.g., Serilog) and potentially an APM tool.   

4.  **Optimized Story Caching (Distributed Lock):**
    * **Improvement:** Implement a **Distributed Lock** (e.g., using RedLock) during the `WarmupCacheAsync` operation.
    * **Improvement:** Implement Pagination for Top Stories. Modify the `Get` endpoint to support `pageNumber` and `pageSize` parameters, allowing clients to retrieve stories in chunks.
    * **Why:** Prevents multiple instances of the API (in a scale-out scenario) from simultaneously attempting to warm up the cache when they start up or at the same interval, reducing unnecessary load on the external HN API.

5.  **Configuration via `appsettings`:**
    * **Improvement:** Move hardcoded constants like `MaxStoriesToCache` (200), `CacheDurationMinutes` (2), and `WarmupIntervalMinutes` (2) from `HackerNewsService.cs` to the `appsettings.json` file.
    * **Why:** Simplifies configuration management and allows runtime tuning of the application without rebuilding the code.

6.  **Transitioning to a Production-Ready Database:**
    * I choose use SQLite on the application to show some other skills, such as JWT Token. This approach is straightforward and effective for development and demonstration, ensuring data persistence across container restarts.
     However, for a production environment, it is acknowledged that SQLite has limitations, particularly concerning high concurrency and scalability. As the application grows, potential database locking issues could arise, impacting performance and reliability.
     As a key step for future enhancement, the database backend should be migrated to a more robust, production-grade solution such as PostgreSQL, SQL Server or other.
     This transition would offer several advantages:
        * Improved Concurrency: Handling a higher volume of simultaneous read/write operations without performance degradation.
        * Greater Scalability: Allowing the application to scale horizontally across multiple instances.
        * Advanced Features: Providing more robust features for data management, security, and administration.
        * This architectural improvement would ensure the application is prepared for the demands of a real-world, scalable service.
     
7.  **Integration Tests:**
    * **Improvement:** Ensure good test coverage, especially for `AuthService`, `HackerNewsService`, and `StoriesController`.
